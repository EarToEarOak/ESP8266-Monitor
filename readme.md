## Requirements

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/)
- [Arduino ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager)
- ArduinoJSON Library (installed via the Arduino IDE)
- [Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library (included)](https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library)



## Usage

![](schematic\breadboard.png)

Edit 'config.h' changing the necessary `#define` statements to suit your needs:

- SSID_NAME: The name of your WiFi access point
- SSID_PASSWORD: The WiFi password
- INTERVAL:  The time between measurements (if this is too short it will never deep sleep)
- VCC: The power supply voltage (3 - 3.6 v)
- DIVIDER: If you have a voltage divider on the ADC input



Use the Arduino IDE to upload the 'ESP8266_Monitor.ino' sketch.



## Examples
